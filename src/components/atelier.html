      <p class="text-md leading-relaxed">
        <em>Realish Diwali</em> is an ongoing research project that reimagines
        traditional Diwali celebrations through a multiplayer virtual reality
        experience. Focused on sustainability and cultural preservation, the
        experience blends magical realism with environmental messaging to
        simulate firecracker bursting — minus the pollution. This project also
        explores the adoption of digital rituals and aims to understand how
        immersive storytelling and gamification can drive behavioral change. The
        project is designed both as a pedagogical tool and a research study at
        the intersection of XR, culture, and sustainability.

      <p class="text-md leading-relaxed">
        <em>The Silence that Remains</em> is an immersive XR art concept in
        progress, being developed for submission to India HCI. The project was
        sparked by the evocative composition
        <span class="font-semibold text-beige"
          >"The Silence that Remains – Mokshamu Galada"</span
        >
        by Indian Carnatic Progressive Rock band
        <span class="font-semibold text-beige">Agam</span>, and draws artistic
        inspiration from the revolutionary
        <span class="font-semibold text-beige">volumism</span> style pioneered
        by VR artist
        <span class="font-semibold text-beige">Anna Zhilyaeva</span>. At its
        core, the piece reflects on themes of climate change, loss, and inner
        stillness. More will be shared once the work is ready for public
        showcase.
